# pnGraph

This is a repository about petrinets. Due to a lecture at university I created this project simultanious to my studies.
To create own petrinets we used pn-strings. These are used as inputs to create the petrinets.
The ```toString()``` Methods create an output to display graphs with [graphViz](http://www.graphviz.org/).
